### Import necessary packages

I will first import all the necessary packages. As I'll do data analysis, I'll use R built in functions and also `ggplot` to plot certain graphs about the data to get better insights into it.

```{r}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library('ggplot2')
```

### Import data

The next step is to import the data that we will work with. I've taken the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/download) about **medical apppointments** with 13 features and a lable describing whether the person showed up for the appointment or not.

```{r}
medical.dataset <- read.csv('data/dataset.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',')
head(medical.dataset)
```

The dataset is now loaded into the notebook. Let's start exploring more information about the data.
